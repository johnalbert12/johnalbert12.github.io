    <div class="section">
        I'm a senior at Cal Poly studying Information Systems and the founder of Albert AI. 
        I help local businesses in San Luis Obispo understand the usefullness of AI through 
        free 30-minute consultations.

        <h2>About Albert AI</h2>
        <p>
            The way I work has changed dramatically due to the continuous improvement of AI. 
            As someone who spends a fair amount of time experimenting with these tools, I've considered 
            that perhaps not everyone is experiencing the same productivity gains that I have. I see this project 
            as an opportunity to be boots on the ground – to learn whether small businesses are adopting this technology and, 
            hopefully, to provide practical advice about how AI can address actual business needs. I pulled a list 
            of more than 200 local SLO businesses, gathered phone numbers and emails, and began conducting cold outreach.

        <h2>Client Stories</h2>
        <div class="client-story">
            <h3 class="story-header">BA Start Arcade and Taproom - January 24, 2025</h3>
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>My first consultation was with BA Start Arcade and Taproom in downtown SLO. The business combines an arcade gaming venue with a full-service bar and kitchen, hosting everything from corporate events to gaming tournaments. The owner, with ties to the tech industry and Silicon Valley, launched this business venture two years ago.</p>
                <p>The consultation revealed some important insights about AI adoption in local businesses. Despite the owner's background, AI tools aren't part of his daily operations, citing the inability of AI to conduct tasks at a human level of quality. He believes that AI won't begin replacing jobs for another 20 years - I don't hold him to that ballpark prediction, but this perspective highlights the disconnect between the tech world and main street business.</p> 
                <p>Through discovery, I learned that a large aspect of the business is social networking. The owner has hired two full-time employees to run their social media pages. He emphasized the importance of creative approaches assisting in the pursuit of building name recognition. I asked Claude to create 6 months worth of weekly events and used examples of events that they've promoted in the past (Jenga night, Smash Bros tourney, Karaoke night, etc.) to assist in this process. Claude was able to come up with new ideas that were relevant to San Luis Obispo e.g, Fraternity vs. Sorority game night. We focused on this example, and in seconds, were able to generate several social media posting ideas and svg flyers. What surprised him was the iterative process of communicating with Claude. After Claude drafted the first flyer, we continued prompting several more versions until he received a result to his liking. We used descriptive language, and provided an example of a flyer that he's created in the past.</p> 
                <p>This underscores what I think is most important right now in communicating with AI systems - the ability to provide clarity and context. The improvements in performance are most noticeable when LLMs have a clear understanding of what you're looking to accomplish. I suspect this to be an area of focus – helping business owners understand that at their current stage, you should treat these systems as a highly capable assistant with amnesia. Context is key.</p> 
                <p>Going forward, I plan to develop a system prompt for Claude that will ask business owners quick hitters on their business, goals, and challenges. This way, these sessions will be more interactive. I found that there was some awkward idle time while I was typing a prompt. If I can conduct the discovery process through Claude, then shifting gears to potential use cases will feel more natural – for both the client and Claude.</p>
                <p>Claude's computer use demonstration particularly resonated, showing how AI could automate various aspects of the owner's business operations, specifically business communications. This was the real "knock-your-socks-off moment." He showed me long lists of emails, texts, and Slack messages that he responds to. He envisioned a world where an AI system is integrated with his calendar and can act on his behalf, just like a personal assistant. I hope that I can have another visit with him when this is possible! I suspect it will be soon.</p>
                <p>One clear challenge the owner faces is creative design - he has hired three artists for their pinball league logo without success. While we explored AI solutions for this, it highlighted current limitations in AI's creative capabilities because it couldn't quite create the logo he was looking for. We also conducted a competitive analysis of other Barcades within a two hour radius using DeepSeek's WebSearch feature. Though he found this interesting, he was able to point out a lot of inaccuracies in the analysis, both about his own value proposition and details about competitors as well.</p>
                <p>We wrapped the session by sharing a beer and swapping stories about life beyond business/AI. I am very thankful for the time that he gave me. I'm happy to have my first consultation under my belt. I'm excited to build on this and meet with other clients!</p>

    <h3 class="story-header">SLO Landscaping - January 27, 2025</h3>
    <div class="story-content">
        <p>I met the owner of SLO Landscaping at Scout Coffee on Monday morning. After my first consultation on Friday, I've come up with a much better way of leading these meetings. I began by explaining how chatting with Claude works at a basic level. I created a system prompt (which can be found in the materials section) that interviewed the owner, focusing on gathering context about what a typical day looks like and what some of his challenges might be. This was very effective in facilitating a natural conversation about his business goals and what some of his pain points are. With the assistance of Claude, I ran an effective discovery session. His business focuses mainly on commercial maintenance. As the founder and owner, he spreads himself pretty thin – delegating employees, growing relationships with customers, managing finances on QuickBooks, creating marketing content, and occasionally visiting job sites.</p>

        <p>The owner started SLO Landscaping in 2017: "After my wife and I had my son, I wanted to do something that gave me more autonomy in my schedule – this can be difficult when you're working for someone else." He grew up in LA working with his father who also owned a landscaping business. During the discovery session, Claude asked questions about his general thoughts around AI. He has heard about "the ChatGPT thing" from his son, but doesn't have good feelings about AI: "I don't have positive feelings about AI. We're letting something do everything for us, making us dumber." He also said that part of his disconnect from the AI/tech world is due to the nature of the landscaping business: "There is not a lot of advancement from a tech standpoint in our industry…there are now robot lawn mowers though!" When I started Albert AI, I was looking forward to interacting with clients like this. Those who, through no fault of their own, have been on the outside of the AI echo chamber.</p>

        <p>Claude was able to identify two areas where the owner could see immediate productivity gains: business communications and marketing. The need for assistance in these areas was confirmed by the owner: "I actually did use AI once recently in an email. Writing is not a strong suit of mine, so it helped me a lot. It was able to rewrite my email and I liked that version more." I prepared a casual landscaping communication beforehand so I could demonstrate how Claude can respond to emails: "Hey Sarah - took a look at ur backyard today. Think we can do something really nice with it - clear out those old bushes, put in a nice patio w some built in lighting. Prob looking at 8-10k range depending what stone u want. Can get started next week if ur interested. Lmk if u wanna meet up tmrw to go over details." I prompted Claude by giving it the persona of a "communication specialist skilled in email writing and tone adaptation." He was pleased with the results that we received and found great use in Claude's ability to understand tone: "I don't understand tone. I'm older, I didn't grow up texting. I can't tell if someone is mad, happy, or just fine." I'm sure we all have parents who face similar challenges when texting. I know for myself, sometimes it feels as if I'm not communicating with my dad, but rather some type of call center robot texting machine. I think it is taken for granted how, like learning a language, you develop a fluency in deciphering digital messages when you grow up texting. This is similar to becoming an effective prompter, and why I advise everybody to start communicating with AI systems ASAP.</p>

        <p>After this, I showed the owner how we could feed Claude data from his QuickBooks and create useful visualizations. I demonstrated this feature by asking Claude to analyze over 10,000 rows of sample sales data. He was surprised by the speed at which Claude was able to create a dashboard highlighting sales by region, sales by customer segment, and most popular service. The owner had this to say about marketing: "We use yelp and home advisor. I don't see results from Google ads. We paid someone for social media but it was hard to monetize it. I'm not paying anyone for that now but I know it's important, but it is time consuming." This is when the importance of context clicked with the owner. At this point, Claude already had a solid understanding of the business, so creating relevant marketing messages was just a prompt away. Claude was now essentially a SLO Landscaping employee (just without the shovel skills). I also showcased Claude's computer use capabilities by asking it to navigate to the contact section of the SLO Landscaping website. He was able to see how the repetitive tasks he completes through QuickBooks could soon be automated.</p>

        <p>"If I had to give you any advice going forward as you keep doing this, lead with why you're doing this. Tell people why you're calling them out of the blue and offering to help them for free. That's not normal in today's society." That was part of the closing exchange between myself and the owner of SLO Landscaping. Earlier in the consultation, he stopped to ask why I was doing this; he wanted to know what my angle was, or if he was being sold anything. I explained that I'm genuinely interested in promoting the adoption of this technology that's changing the way we work and, more importantly, the fabric of society as a whole. I pointed him to this website (which was built with the assistance of Claude) and showed how I'm documenting this journey. As we reached the end of our 30 minute session, I asked if his outlook on AI has changed and if he will begin to use these tools: "I know I have to evolve with the times, so I'm glad to have gained a better understanding about how AI can help me." The owner plans to experiment with Claude, incorporating both the web and mobile versions into his workflow. It was a beautiful morning in San Luis Obispo; I'm grateful that the owner gave up his time to grab a cup of coffee and talk about AI.</p>

    <h3 class="story-header">Jeff's - January 29, 2025</h3>
    <div class="story-content">
        <p>For my third consultation, I visited Jeff's, a vintage clothing store in downtown SLO. The store opened in September of 2024. The owner, Jeff, is 30 years old and is passionate about the mission of his business: "I have a passion for vintage clothing and trying to eliminate fast fashion in the clothing world. I think it's a big problem – caring about the climate is a core value of our business and helped ignite my flame for entrepreneurship." Jeff worked in the creative space prior to opening Jeff's, primarily focused on video production. Jeff is optimistic about the future of AI: "I use ChatGPT slightly, I think it's sick; it's the future. I think it's funny that schools hate it so much." Sidetrack – I really agree. From a student's perspective, it's clear that AI has been mismanaged in schools thus far. It has been more than two years since ChatGPT became one of the most popular consumer technologies, yet there have been no noticeable changes in class curriculums to reflect the new capabilities that we've been armed with. It's like we're playing basketball on Fisher-Price hoops. Moving on…</p>

        <p>I was excited that Jeff was open to experimenting with these tools. Through the Claude-assisted discovery process (using the system prompt in the materials section), I learned that a significant portion of Jeff's day-to-day responsibilities involve digital tasks, mostly inputting information into shopify and making sure his online inventory stays current. I have never used Shopify, but Jeff was able to show me what this process looks like. I was surprised to learn that there's already a number of AI features integrated into Shopify e.g, a GenAI product description tool, and a sales analysis dashboard that creates visualizations related to product performance. In these cases, it seems like using an external AI tool would be unnecessary.</p>

        <p>Jeff spends a lot of time managing his employees. Jeff considers all of his in store employees to be a part of his "team of marketers" – everybody that works at the store plays a part in maintaining Jeff's active social media presence by creating content. Jeff has hired a full-time social media manager to keep things running smoothly. I asked Jeff if he ever has considered managing social media himself:  "I certainly have a hard time delegating away all of the social media work because of my background in video – I still spend time coming up with new ideas." I then gave Claude the persona of a "social media strategist specializing in local business marketing in the San Luis Obispo area" and requested Claude to create a two week schedule for social media posts. We assisted Claude in this process by adding some more relevant details (remember, context is key): "I am looking to create short form content on Instagram, our content is targeted toward Cal Poly students." Jeff saw some value here: "I can see how Claude could be used as a brainstorming buddy." Exactly – now that Claude has spent some time getting to understand Jeff and his business, it is much more effective in creating outputs that may actually be useful. This is what I hope clients see after these sessions.</p>

        <p>During the discovery process, Claude asked Jeff if he experiences any challenges in business communications: "I spend some time texting employees and maintaining relationships with returning customers, but I wouldn't describe this as any sort of pain point." Claude then suggested, by itself, that it could help create newsletters for customers that have purchased from Jeff's. Jeff hasn't considered creating a members only newsletter, but he acknowledged that this was a "good idea."  Based on the fact that Jeff doesn't struggle with business communications, and given the nature of retail, Claude saw an opportunity for Jeff's to enhance customer relationships. This wasn't Claude simply acting as a brainstorming partner, this seems to be at least a step above that - Claude engaged in actual strategic business thinking by connecting relevant information to generate meaningful recommendations.</p>

        <p>At about 20 minutes into the session, we said goodbye to our friend, Claude, and said hello to CCP agent, DeepSeek. I wanted to enable DeepSeeks search feature to conduct a competitive analysis and also to pull information from the internet to discover trends in vintage clothing (I hope Claude rolls out a search feature soon, so I don't have to continue using DeepSeek, because it seems like clients are getting a lot of value out of this). The competitive analysis was interesting – DeepSeek conducted an entire SWOT analysis in about 10 seconds of four competitors, two of which Jeff had never heard of. I think a lot of this information is valuable. I noticed that, as someone who is used to communicating with AI systems, I take some of these outputs for granted. I think I can be quick to move on to the next prompt when it may be wise to spend some time letting the client grasp what's in front of them.</p>

        <p>I ended this session demonstrating Claude's beta version of computer use. This has kind of become my grand finale if you will. I showed Jeff how fast Claude could begin clicking around in Shopify with just one prompt. As mentioned earlier, Jeff spends a lot of time in Shopify, so a tool that could automate this for him would be "game-changing." I think the theme of these sessions so far have been consistent: letting AI gather lots of context about your business + growth in your prompting skills = noticeable improvements in performance – which leads to more practical ways in which AI can help your business. At its current stage, AI might still be somewhat limited; they aren't magic boxes that can solve all your problems, but, if you are skilled at working with these tools, I promise that you will see real productivity gains. And it's best to start now – the slight productivity gains you notice today will turn into massive productivity gains as new features and versions of these models continue to drop every couple of months. I sent Jeff a follow up email thanking him for his time and highlighting some of the tools/prompts we used. I don't think it'll be long until I see Jeff again though – I saw a vintage Seahawks hat in there that I just might have to cop. #GoHawks</p>
